            Norman, Oklahoma, was established in 1889 during the Land Run era, a
            period of rapid settlement in the American West. Named after Abner
            Norman, a Santa Fe Railroad surveyor, the city burgeoned around the
            University of Oklahoma, which was founded in 1890. Situated in the
            heart of Oklahoma, Norman enjoys a central geographic location
            within the state, offering easy access to major highways and
            transportation networks. Its rich history, combined with a vibrant
            cultural scene and strong educational institutions, has made Norman
            a thriving community with a diverse population.
          </p>
          <p class="card-P">
            Norman's average household income stands at around $54,000 per year,
            slightly below the national average. However, this figure varies
            across different neighborhoods and demographic groups within the
            city. The economy of Norman is driven by a mix of industries,
            including education, healthcare, technology, and manufacturing. Its
            proximity to Oklahoma City, just 20 miles away, provides additional
            employment opportunities for residents. Despite economic
            fluctuations, Norman continues to grow steadily, attracting
            newcomers drawn to its affordable living costs, quality schools, and
            friendly suburban atmosphere.

          <p class="card-P">
            1. Home to the National Weather Center: Norman is home to the
            National Weather Center, which houses various weather-related
            organizations and research centers, including the National Severe
            Storms Laboratory and the Storm Prediction Center. It's a key
            location for meteorological research and weather forecasting in the

            2. Annual Medieval Fair: Norman hosts the annual Medieval Fair, one
            of the largest of its kind in the region. The event, held each
            spring, attracts visitors from all over and features medieval-themed

            3. Legacy of the Land Run: Norman's origins are closely tied to the
            famous Land Run of 1889. It was one of the many towns that sprang up
            overnight as settlers rushed to claim land in what was then called
            the Unassigned Lands. This historical event is a significant part of
            Norman's heritage and is celebrated with various historical markers
            and local festivities
